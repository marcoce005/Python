# Palindromes
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:
 - asks the user for some text;
 - checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints the result.

Note:
 - assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
 - treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
 - spaces are not taken into account during the check – treat them as non-existent;
 - there are more than a few correct solutions – try to find more than one.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
