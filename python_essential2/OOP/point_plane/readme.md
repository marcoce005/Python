# Points on a plane
Let's visit a very special place â€“ a plane with the Cartesian coordinate system (you can learn more about this concept here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system).

Each point located on the plane can be described as a pair of coordinates customarily called x and y. We want you to write a Python class which stores both coordinates as float numbers. Moreover, we want the objects of this class to evaluate the distances between any of the two points situated on the plane.

The task is rather easy if you employ the function named hypot() (available through the *math* module) which evaluates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse) and here: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html#trigonometric-functions.

This is how we imagine the class:
 - it's called ```Point```;
 - its constructor accepts two arguments (x and y respectively), both of which default to zero;
 - all the properties should be private;
 - the class contains two parameterless methods called ```getx()``` and ```gety()```, which return each of the two coordinates (the coordinates are stored privately, so they cannot be accessed directly from within the object);
 - the class provides a method called ```distance_from_xy(x,y)```, which calculates and returns the distance between the point stored inside the object and the other point given as a pair of floats;
 - the class provides a method called ```distance_from_point(point)```, which calculates the distance (like the previous method), but the other point's location is given as another Point class object;

Start from this code.

```python
import math


class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def getx(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def gety(self):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def distance_from_xy(self, x, y):
        #
        # Write code here
        #

    def distance_from_point(self, point):
        #
        # Write code here
        #


point1 = Point(0, 0)
point2 = Point(1, 1)
print(point1.distance_from_point(point2))
print(point2.distance_from_xy(2, 0))
